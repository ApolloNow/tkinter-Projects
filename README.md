# tkinter-Projects

Hello and Welcome to this repo
Here i have created some desktop applications using the Python's tkinter package.
If you are not familiar with tkinter: The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit. 
Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, including macOS, as well as on Windows systems.
This framework provides Python users with a simple way to create GUI elements using the widgets found in the Tk toolkit. Tk widgets can be used to construct buttons, 
menus, data fields, etc. in a Python application. Once created, these graphical elements can be associated with or interact with features, functionality, methods, 
data or even other widgets. 

If you want ro run any of these applications, Please install tkinter on your machine if not already done so. 
pip install tk
